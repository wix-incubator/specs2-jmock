# Publishing to Maven Central

Publishing to Maven Central is done automatically on GitHub release (by a GitHub action).\
When releasing a new version, the tag must be prefixed a lowercase `v` followed immidiately by a digit.\
For example the tag `v1.6.0`, will be published to Maven Central as version `1.6.0`
